    <h3 id="audience">1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h2>
    <p>The SRS is intended for software developers, designers, project managers and testers. The document is intended to be read sequentially as it is. </p>

    <h3 id="scope">1.4	Product Scope</h2>
    <p>Ashbab is an online platform for buying furniture and home decor online. But what makes it different from other e-commerce websites is that with Augmented Reality buyers can get an idea of what they are going to buy and how it may look in their room. When the users find a suitable place for the furniture, they can place the furniture there and then move the phone to see how the furniture looks at that position. The users can zoom in or out which will give them more satisfaction about the furniture and the position of the furniture.<br>

      The seller will have to provide exact specifications of a furniture. Our design team will then create a 3D model of the furniture and that will be used for augmentation. This photo will be given to the user which will float on the camera screen when the user selects that furniture. The camera will be able to detect plains. The furniture can be placed on a selected plain and it will be anchored there. The object will stay at the selected place and the user will be able to move around and see the furniture from every angle.<br>
      
      There will be an android app to support the AR feature. There will also be a web app which won’t have the augmented reality option but the user will be able to buy furniture and view the catalogue from the website.

    <h2 id="overallDescription">2. Overall Description</h2>
      <p>This section will give an overview of the whole system. The system will be explained in its context to show how the system interacts with other systems and introduce the basic functionality of it. It will also describe what type of stakeholders that will use the system and what functionality is available for each type. At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented.</p>

    <h3 id="perspective">2.1 Product Perspective</h2>
      <p>This system will consist of two parts: one android application and one web portal. The mobile application will be used by the buyers who will be able to buy the products and view the products in AR. The web portal will be used by both the buyers and the sellers. The buyers can buy and the sellers can upload their product descriptions.<br>
        The android application needs and version 7.0 or above. Android phones with version 7.0 or above comes with necessary hardware required for augmented reality support. The mobile app will be using the camera of the smartphone to implement the AR features. <br>
        The mobile application and the web application will both have a database to store product data and user data. The web portal will have read, write and modify access of the database but the mobile app will only have read access. All database communication will happen through internet.
        </p>
    
    <h3 id="functions">2.2 Product Functions</h2>
      <p>With the mobile application the user will be able to buy furniture. The special feature of this app will be to see the product before buying in Augmented Reality. The users will also be able to search for a specific product with name or find it from the category menu. <br>

        The web portal will have two parts, one for the administrator and another one is for the buyers. The buyers will be able to buy furniture from here also. But the website won’t be supporting any AR feature. As a result, the web portal will be accessible from any device as it won’t have any hardware constrain. The admins of the portal will be able to add new products with details, receive orders and also get analytical data on sales.<br>
        </p>

    <h3 id="characteristics">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h2>
      <p>There are two types of users of the platform. The buyers and the administrators.<br>

        The buyers will be able to use the mobile app and the web app. They can use all the features the mobile app provides.<br>
        
        The administrator will take product data from the sellers and will upload them on the web portal. They will not have access to any management features from the mobile application.
        </p>

    <h3 id="environment">2.4 Operating Environment</h2>
      <p>For Android:<br><br>

        Operating System: Android 7.0<br>
        Disk Space: 100 MB<br>
        RAM: 1 GB<br>
        </p>

    <h3 id="constraints">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h2>
      <p>As this an online application, internet connection is a constraint. Internet connection is crucial for the application to fetch data from the database over the internet.<br>
        Both the web portal and the mobile application will be constrained by the capacity of the database. Since the database is shared between both application it may be forced to queue incoming requests and therefor increase the time it takes to fetch data.<br>
        Android version is a mobile software constraint as the SDK used requires android version 7.0 and above. Also, the need of a camera, gyro, accelerometer is hardware constraint for the android application as without these the AR feature will not work.
        </p>

    <h3 id="userDoc">2.6 User Documentation</h2>
      <p>The platform is just entering development stage. Once the development is completed and a prototype a released user documentation will be provided.</p>

    <h3 id="assumptions">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h2>
      <p>One assumption for the android application is the application will be used mostly on high-end or latest phones as for a few years as the hardware requirement can only be met on those phones.<br>
        Another assumption is phones with good camera will be providing the best performance as plane detection depends on the picture quality of the camera.<br>
        Proper browser should be used for the web app and a stable internet connection is required.
        </p>

    <h2 id="exInterface">3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
      <p>All inputs and outputs necessary for the requirements will be specified in this section. Hardware, Software and communication interfaces will also be characterized here.</p>
        
    <h3 id="ui">3.1 User Interfaces</h2>
      <p>When the user uses the service for the first time, they will be prompted the registration page. Already registered users can select to login through a button which will bring them to a log-in page. Name, Password, Address, Phone Number will be collected from the registration page. Users should be able to login by using their email and password.<br>
        User can omit the login process on the web version of the system, they will be opted to login in future if they make a purchase.<br>
        If the user is already logged into the system, they will land on the home page. The home page will show the most recent uploaded products to the buyers. Buyers will be able to search the products based on title or category tags of the products.<br>
        Every user will have a profile page from where they can view/edit their user information. They can also delete their account from this page. Buyers can also see their previously ordered products status from this view.<br><br>
        
        When a consumer clicks on a product it will bring them to that specific product detail page. This page will contain name, retailer and description of the product. If the consumer is on the mobile app, they can also view the product via AR. This functionality will not be implemented in the web version. But on the mobile app a camera interface will open and show them the 3D model of the product.<br>
        The product page will contain a rating system and a comment section where people that previously bought the product will be able to comment about the product.<br><br>
        
        Sellers can see their previously uploaded products from the administrator interface. They can see sales information, analytics and the orders that have been placed already. They will be able to add new products with detailed information and also remove an existing product.
        </p>
        
    <h3 id="hi">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h2>
      <p>Neither the mobile application nor the web version has any special hardware requirements. So, the system will not have any hardware interface.  The camera required for AR experience is assumed to be provided by the mobile phones where the app will be installed.</p>

    <h3 id="si">3.3 Software Interfaces</h2>
      <p>Both the mobile application and the website will communicate with the database via internet. The operating system will provide such interfaces. Both the platforms will consist of operations regarding read and write of data.</p>

    <h3 id="ci">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h2>
      <p>The means of communication between the different part of the system is not important and will be handled by the operations provided by the browser or operating system.</p>


    <h2 id="systemFeatures">4. System Features</h2>
      <p>This section includes the requirements that describe all the essential functions of the system.<br>
        The naming convention will follow the following conventions<br>
        PFRx – Primary functional requirement<br>
